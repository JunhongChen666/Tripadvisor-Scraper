We specialize in fine authentic ancient art from Europe, the Middle East, North Africa, Central America and South America. We are passionate about our shared past and want to share our admiration of antiquity. Throughout the year, the gallery prepares thematic exhibitions of ancient art for everyone to enjoy. Our current exhibition ""LIGHT ON STONE"", intermixes contemporary photography with ancient sculpture. The installation features an elegant Venus Genetrix, a marble relief depicting a Nereid and Hippocamp previously owned by actor Charlton Heston, and a massive architectural Corbel. These three-dimensional works are displayed alongside Mr. Coscia's photogrpahy. Many of Mr. Coscia photographs present museum works removed from the museum setting. Two images in the exhibition capture how modern objects can be manipulated to create a likeness to classical scuplture by exploring their textures, surfaces, and the play of light in varying conditions. Photographs of his own paper sculptures capture the gestures and balance of classical stone works. The exhibition will remain on display through November 26, 2016 Our gallery director, Randall A. Hixenbaugh, has been involved in ancient art and antiquities for over 20 years. We specialize in building collections with our clients, both public and private.
