1,Sandra Ainsley Gallery,Art Galleries,"100 Sunrise Ave Unit 150, Toronto, Ontario M4A 1B3 Canada","Sandra Ainsley Gallery's early beginnings were located in Hazelton Lanes in Toronto's Yorkville area from 1984 to 1994. Before opening the location was the concept of placing the gallery in a retail setting, much like how you would see in Japan with art primarily selling in high end department stores. In 1989, the gallery opened a location in the lobby of the Toronto Stock Exchange, it was a mechanical room and a very large rough space requiring an architect to create the space. The space launched with a opening exhibition of works by Dale Chihuly, his first exhibition in Canada and the beginning of a very long relationship. The location was designed to allow the gallery to better meet the needs of both private and corporate clients with an already impressive roster of international artists. This is where many corporate clients found the gallery an oasis in the middle of the financial district. It was a unique location and initially people wondered, but it thrived and was an introduction to clients the gallery still does business with. One very important show of note was in 1998 when the gallery did an installation with Dale Chihuly that opened in conjunction with his show Tower of David in Israel, which was a very significant show for the artist. The main gallery moved to the Distillery District from 2002 to 2008 while the other location was still under operation. The space was around 8000 square feet. The gallery took yet another risk and was the first tenant in the area. Again people would question why anyone would open a gallery there. When the new space opened in November, the inaugural exhibition had over 2000 people in attendance and pioneered the largest exhibition by Dale Chihuly ever held in a private gallery. The Distillery District has went on to become a major tourist destination in Toronto. They have now relocated since September 2012 to a renovated industrial warehouse in a location where again one wouldn't quite expect to find a gallery. The space with its 22-foot ceilings, dramatic lighting, and open-concept layout is an ideal backdrop to show the gallery's trademark collections of outstanding artworks. For the third decade, the gallery relocated once again with another inaugural Dale Chihuly exhibition. The new space was designed especially to represent international artists who work primarily in glass, clay and mixed media and has consistently shown many of the same artists over the last 30 years such as Toots Zynski, Martin Blank, Dan Daily, and Phillip Baldwin & Monica Guggisberg. These large-scale installations, flexible and highly contemporary and insist that viewers raise questions. The gallery also has a focus on emerging talent from all over the world, but specifically Canadian.",Duration: < 1 hour,4.5,3,11:00 AM - 6:00 PM,
