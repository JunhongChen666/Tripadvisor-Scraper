The Sewall House has stood strong on Capitol Hill for over two hundred years. Early occupants of the house participated in the formulation of Congress and witnessed the construction of the US Capitol and the Supreme Court. In 1929, the National Woman's Party (NWP) purchased the house, and it soon evolved into a center for feminist education and social change. For over sixty years, the trail-blazing NWP utilized the strategic location of the house to lobby for women's political, social, and economic equality.Today, the National Woman's Party tells the compelling story of a community of women who dedicated their lives to the fight for women's rights. The innovative tactics and strategies these women devised became the blueprint for women's progress throughout the twentieth century. The Museum exhibits highlight the tactics and strategies used during the 20th century women's rights movement. Artifacts from the NWP collection bring the story to life. Public Programs showcase the Museum's commitment to continuing conversations on women's progress while examining the ongoing national and international quest for women's equality.The site was dedicated as a National Monument for its significance to the history of the United States.",,4.5,53,,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/11/17/18/46/front-of-belmont-paul.jpg?w=900&h=600&s=1

Since Christian Heurich had closed the doors to his brewery in the 1950s, Washington DC had no brewery whose products were available in local stores and on tap outside its site of production. There were brewpubs, yes, but no breweries. Enter Brandon Skall & Jeff Hancock. Starting in 2009, the duo went about filling the glaring void in the local beer market. Two years later, on Tax Day 2011, DC Brau Brewing Company officially tapped its first keg of beer entirely brewed, packaged and sold within the District of Columbia. Since then, the brewery has crafted award-winning beer — utilizing a delicious and uniquely American blend of North American and European techniques and ingredients — with distribution throughout the greater National Capital Region, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and beyond.",Duration: < 1 hour,4.0,12,4:00 PM - 9:00 PM,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0d/8b/95/91/the-line-of-vats.jpg?w=900&h=600&s=1

Our vision is to build a world-class museum in D.C. We currently offer walking tours on many topics leaving from different parts of the DC metro area. In Their Footsteps Suffrage Walking Tour Through imagery and visits to key locations in the DC area, gain an understanding of the suffragist struggle for equality and the right to vote. The American woman suffrage movement is recognized as officially starting in 1848, at the Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention in New York. Over the next 72 years, generations of activist women (and men) worked tirelessly until the 19th Amendment was adopted. It took the efforts of a wide range of women, from the most radical advocates of male and female equality, to women who saw the right to vote as necessary to more effectively advocate for moral and social reform. Their efforts to succeed set the stage for grassroots efforts to come, proving that determined citizens can achieve change. The tour begins at the top of the escalator at the Archives/Navy Memorial Metro stop on Pennsylvania Avenue. The tour will cover about 1.2 miles, last about two hours, and end near the Sewall-Belmont House and Museum. Women of Civil War Alexandria Walking Tour Learn more about women's roles during the Civil War in Alexandria, Virginia. Alexandria was in a unique position during the Civil War. It was a city with Southern sympathies continuously occupied by the Union Army and virtually operating as a Northern supply depot due to its proximity to Washington, DC and its transportation infrastructure. The women who remained in Alexandria and those who came during occupation experienced the War not as a battle but a day-to-day way of life. This tour will explore the stories of a diverse group of women and their experiences living in Civil War Alexandria. This tour starts at The Lyceum in Old Town Alexandria, the nearest metro is King St-Old Town which serves the Yellow and Blue lines. Free parking during the tour is available at The Lyceum. The tour is about 1 mile long, will last about an hour and a half, and end at The Lyceum.",Duration: 1-2 hours,0,0,,https://dynamic-media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-o/0c/1a/ad/b0/walking-tour.jpg?w=900&h=600&s=1
