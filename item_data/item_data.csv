238,Art Galleries,"""Sandra Ainsley Gallery's early beginnings were located in Hazelton Lanes in Toronto's Yorkville area from 1984 to 1994. Before opening the location was the concept of placing the gallery in a retail setting, much like how you would see in Japan with art primarily selling in high end department stores. In 1989, the gallery opened a location in the lobby of the Toronto Stock Exchange, it was a mechanical room and a very large rough space requiring an architect to create the space. The space launched with a opening exhibition of works by Dale Chihuly, his first exhibition in Canada and the beginning of a very long relationship. The location was designed to allow the gallery to better meet the needs of both private and corporate clients with an already impressive roster of international artists. This is where many corporate clients found the gallery an oasis in the middle of the financial district. It was a unique location and initially people wondered, but it thrived and was an introduction to clients the gallery still does business with. One very important show of note was in 1998 when the gallery did an installation with Dale Chihuly that opened in conjunction with his show Tower of David in Israel, which was a very significant show for the artist. The main gallery moved to the Distillery District from 2002 to 2008 while the other location was still under operation. The space was around 8000 square feet. The gallery took yet another risk and was the first tenant in the area. Again people would question why anyone would open a gallery there. When the new space opened in November, the inaugural exhibition had over 2000 people in attendance and pioneered the largest exhibition by Dale Chihuly ever held in a private gallery. The Distillery District has went on to become a major tourist destination in Toronto. They have now relocated since September 2012 to a renovated industrial warehouse in a location where again one wouldn't quite expect to find a gallery. The space with its 22-foot ceilings, dramatic lighting, and open-concept layout is an ideal backdrop to show the gallery's trademark collections of outstanding artworks. For the third decade, the gallery relocated once again with another inaugural Dale Chihuly exhibition. The new space was designed especially to represent international artists who work primarily in glass, clay and mixed media and has consistently shown many of the same artists over the last 30 years such as Toots Zynski, Martin Blank, Dan Daily, and Phillip Baldwin & Monica Guggisberg. These large-scale installations, flexible and highly contemporary and insist that viewers raise questions. The gallery also has a focus on emerging talent from all over the world, but specifically Canadian."""

Our vision is to build a world-class museum in D.C. We currently offer walking tours on many topics leaving from different parts of the DC metro area. In Their Footsteps Suffrage Walking Tour Through imagery and visits to key locations in the DC area, gain an understanding of the suffragist struggle for equality and the right to vote. The American woman suffrage movement is recognized as officially starting in 1848, at the Seneca Falls Women's Rights Convention in New York. Over the next 72 years, generations of activist women (and men) worked tirelessly until the 19th Amendment was adopted. It took the efforts of a wide range of women, from the most radical advocates of male and female equality, to women who saw the right to vote as necessary to more effectively advocate for moral and social reform. Their efforts to succeed set the stage for grassroots efforts to come, proving that determined citizens can achieve change. The tour begins at the top of the escalator at the Archives/Navy Memorial Metro stop on Pennsylvania Avenue. The tour will cover about 1.2 miles, last about two hours, and end near the Sewall-Belmont House and Museum. Women of Civil War Alexandria Walking Tour Learn more about women's roles during the Civil War in Alexandria, Virginia. Alexandria was in a unique position during the Civil War. It was a city with Southern sympathies continuously occupied by the Union Army and virtually operating as a Northern supply depot due to its proximity to Washington, DC and its transportation infrastructure. The women who remained in Alexandria and those who came during occupation experienced the War not as a battle but a day-to-day way of life. This tour will explore the stories of a diverse group of women and their experiences living in Civil War Alexandria. This tour starts at The Lyceum in Old Town Alexandria, the nearest metro is King St-Old Town which serves the Yellow and Blue lines. Free parking during the tour is available at The Lyceum.
